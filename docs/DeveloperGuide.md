### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<b markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section contains some noteworthy details on how certain features are being implemented.

### Adding a patient into Nursing Address Book

#### Implementation

The add patient feature is facilitated by `AddCommand`, `AddCommandParser` and `LogicManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add patient feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs an add Command (e.g. `add n\Alice ic\A0055679T ad\01/01/2022 dob\01/01/2002 w\WA`) to add a new patient named Alice to the address book.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The format of the add command is as follows:
n\: Indicates the name of the patient
ic\: Indicates the NRIC of the patient
ad\: Indicates the admission date of the patient
dob\: Indicates the date of birth of the patient
w\: Indicates the ward of the patient is currently in
r\: Indicates remarks for the patient (optional)
t\: Indicates the tags of the patient (optional, can have multiple)
</div>

Step 2. The `add` command calls `AddCommandParser#parse(String)` to parse the user input and creates a new `AddCommand` object.

Step 3. The created `AddCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`. Then, `AddCommand` is executed by calling `AddCommand#execute(Model)`.

Step 4. The `AddCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#addPerson(Person)` to add the new patient to the address book.

Step 5. The `CommandResult` from the `AddCommand` object is returned to `LogicManager` and then to `UI` to display the success message.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![AddSequenceDiagram.png](images%2FAddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Editing a patient's details

#### Implementation

Editing a patient's details is facilitated by `EditCommand`, `EditCommandParser` and `LogicManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit patient feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs an edit Command (e.g. `edit 1 w\WB`) to edit the ward of the patient at index 1 in Nursing Address Book.

Step 2. The `edit` command calls `EditCommandParser#parse(String)` to parse the user input. 

Step 3. A new `EditPersonDescriptor` object is created with the new ward details. 
A new `EditCommand` instance will be created with the index of the patient to be edited and the new `EditPersonDescriptor` object.

Step 4. The `EditCommand` instace is returned to the `LogicManager` and `execute` is called.

Step 5. The `EditCommand` instance calls `Model#setPerson(Person, Person)` to edit the patient's details.
The patient specified will have its ward updated to the new ward specified.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![EditSequenceDiagram.png](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)


### Showing help for commands

#### Implementation

The help command is facilitated by the `HelpCommand` class. It allows users to view the usage instructions for the application.



The `HelpCommand` class extends the `Command` interface and is responsible for executing the `help` command. It creates a `CommandResult` object with the help message to be displayed to the user.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following class diagram shows the relevant classes involved in the help command implementation:

Step 1. The `LogicManager` is called to execute the "help" command.
Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` parses the command and creates a new `HelpCommand` instance.
Step 3. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the `HelpCommand`.
Step 4. The `HelpCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` with the help message.
Step 5. The `MainWindow` handles the help command and calls the `handleHelp()` method.
Step 6. The `ResultDisplay` is updated with the help message obtained from `HelpCommand.SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE`.

The `HelpCommand` class interacts with the `Logic` component and utilizes the `CommandResult` class to encapsulate the result of executing the `help` command. The `MainWindow` and `ResultDisplay` classes in the UI component are responsible for handling the display of the help message to the user.


![HelpCommandClassDiagram](images/HelpClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the help command works:

![HelpCommandSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250"/>

When the user executes the help command, the following steps occur:
  

1. The `LogicManager` is called to execute the "help" command.
2. The `AddressBookParser` parses the command and creates a new `HelpCommand` instance.
3. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the `HelpCommand`.
4. The `HelpCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` with the help message.
5. The `MainWindow` handles the help command and calls the `handleHelp()` method.
6. The `ResultDisplay` is updated with the help message obtained from `HelpCommand.SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE`.


The `HelpCommand` class interacts with the `Logic` component and utilizes the `CommandResult` class to encapsulate the result of executing the `help` command. The `MainWindow` and `ResultDisplay` classes in the UI component are responsible for handling the display of the help message to the user.

### Add a patient

#### Implementation

The add patient feature is facilitated by `AddCommand`, `AddCommandParser` and `Person`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add patient feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes an Add Command (e.g. 'add n\Alice ic\A0055679T ad\01/01/2022 dob\01/01/2002 w\WA') to add a new patient to the address book.

n\: Indicates the name of the patient
ic\: Indicates the NRIC of the patient
ad\: Indicates the admission date of the patient
dob\: Indicates the date of birth of the patient
w\: Indicates the ward of the patient is currently in

The `AddCommandParser` parses the user input, creating a new `AddCommand` object.
The `AddCommand` object then creates a new `Person` object with the parsed details.

### List with filter by tags and/or ward feature
#### Introduction
This section describes the implementation of the list with filter by tags and/or ward mechanism in NAB. This mechanism 
allows users to list patients based on their tags and/or ward, on top of listing all patients. This feature is useful 
for nurses to quickly find patients with specific medical conditions or patients in a specific ward.

#### Implementation

The filter by tags and/or ward mechanism is facilitated by `ListCommand`, `ListCommandParser`, `ListKeywordsPredicate`
and `LogicManager`, which implements the `Logic` interface. `LogicManager` holds a `AddressBookParser` that parses the 
user input, and a model where the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`â€” Executes the given user String input to return a `CommandResult` object.

These operations are exposed in the UI interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter by tags and/or ward mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `list t\diabetes` command to list patients with the diabetes tag in the address book. 
- The `list` command triggers `AddressBookParser` to parse the user input, identifying the `list` command word to call
`ListCommandParser#parse(String)` to parse the rest of the user input.

Step 2. `ListCommandParser#parse(String)` parses the user input. If there are subsequent arguments, a 
`ListKeywordPredicate` object is created with the keyword(s) provided. The keywords can be either a ward or tag(s) or both,
supplied by the user with the relevant prefix. In this case, it would be a tag, `t\diabetes`.

Step 3. A new `ListCommand` instance is created using the `ListKeywordsPredicate` object. (If there are no parameters 
provided, it will still simply create a `ListCommand` object.)

The following is a list of objects created thus far:
![ListObjectDiagram](images/ListObjectDiagram.png)

Step 4. The `ListCommand` object is returned to `LogicManager` and `execute` is called. `ListCommand#execute(Model)` 
filters the list of patients in `Model` based on the `ListKeywordsPredicate` object if it is present. (Otherwise, it 
returns the full list of patients.)

Step 5. The filtered list of patients (with diabetes) is displayed to the user through the GUI.

**UML Diagrams:**

The following sequence diagram shows how the listing of relevant patients would work:
![ListCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command to list relevant patients:

<img src="images/ListCommandActivityDiagram2.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Command to filter:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add the parameters to list command instead of find.
    * Pros: More appropriate as `list` will produce a useful list of relevant contacts, whereas `find` implies that only one useful result is expected.
    * Cons: May not have such a clear distinction between `list` and `find`, as user just wants to search for results.

* **Alternative 2:** Add parameters to find command instead of list.
    * Pros: Easy to use, one command will perform all search.
    * Cons: Unable to differentiate usefulness.

**Aspect: Filter by a ward or many wards:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow filtering only by at most 1 ward input.
    * Pros: More targeted; Nurses will only refer to the ward that they are in or are visiting. Otherwise, will filter across all wards.
    * Cons: Does not allow looking at specific, multiple wards.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow multiple ward tags.
    * Pros: Easy to be more specific.
    * Cons: Not relevant for the nurses use case. Allowing more wards also make it harder to filter fast.

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The filter by tags and/or ward mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand`, `FindCommandParser`,
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and
`IcContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

![FindClassDiagram](images/FindClassDiagram.png)

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FindCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses user input and creates a `FindCommand` object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find by name or IC mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `find n\Bob` command to find patient with the name Bob in the address book. The
`FindCommandParser` parses the user input, creating a new `FindCommand` and `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

Step 2. For each patient in the address book, the `predicate` object will be passed to
`Model#updateFilteredPersonList` check if the patient has Bob as part of his/her name. If the patient has the name Bob,
the patient will be shown in result.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Find by full word or letters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow finding by full word only.
    * Pros: More meaningful to find by words instead of just letters.
    * Cons: Harder to search when patient details is insufficient.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow finding by letters.
    * Pros: Able to search even if lacking patient information.
    * Cons: Harder to get specific patient as result will be a list.
