## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` installed in your Computer. You can find out how to identify your current Java version 
[here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html#:~:text=The%20Java%20version%20can%20be%20found%20in%20the%20Java%20Control%20Panel.&text=Under%20the%20General%20tab%20in,About%20showing%20the%20Java%20version), or install Java `11` from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. Download the latest `nab.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your NAB.

4. Open a command terminal. 
   * For Windows users: Search for `cmd` in the Start menu and run it as an administrator if necessary.
   * For Mac/Linux users: Open the "Terminal" application (usually found within your Applications/Utilities folder).

5. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you placed the jar file.

6. Run the application by executing `java -jar nab.jar` on the command terminal.<br>

   Shortly, a GUI resembling the following should display, including some sample input to get you started:<br>
   <br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
   <br>
   <br>
   <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source:
   **Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute commands.** <br> 
   _For Windows users, running the command prompt as an administrator may be
   required. If you encounter permission issues on Mac/Linux, you might need to use `chmod +x nab.jar` to make the file 
   executable._
   </div>
   <br>
   Should you need help navigating the interface, refer to the [Interface](#the-interface) section.

7. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will 
open the help window.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all patients.

   * `add n\John Doe ic\T1234567P dob\01/01/2000 w\A1 ad\25/03/2024` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to the NAB.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

8. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Interface
![Navigation.png](images/Navigation.png)

The main window of NAB is separated into the following sections:
1. **Command Box**: This is where you can input commands to interact with the application. Press `Enter` to execute the 
command.

2. **Display Box**: This is where the application displays feedback for your commands (for e.g., whether it is 
successful, or has an error).

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: <b>Tip:</b>
    You can resize the display box to your liking!
    </div>

3. **Patient Contacts**: This is where the application displays the list of patients.

4. **Data Storage Location**: This is where the application stores the data file.

Additionally, the application provides a **Help** button at the top that you can click to view the list of available 
commands and their formats, apart from the `help` command. Similarly, the **File** button allows you to exit the 
application apart from the `exit` command.

## Features
The features are categorized into two main sections: 
- [**Patient Management Features**](#patient-management-features) includes commands that allow you to manage patient 
records.
- [**General Features**](#general-features) include commands that provide general information and functionality.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: <b>Notes about the command format:</b><br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n\NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n\John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n\NAME [t\TAG]` can be used as `n\John Doe t\FallRisk` or as `n\John Doe`.

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t\TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t\Diabetes`, `t\Diabetes t\HearingImpaired` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME ic\IC_NUMBER`, `ic\IC_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit` or `help`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Patient Management Features
For patient management features, NAB provides the following commands:
- [**Adding a patient**](#adding-a-patient--add): `add`
- [**Listing patients**](#listing-patients--list): `list`
- [**Editing a patient's details**](#editing-a-patients-details--edit): `edit`
- [**Locating patient contacts**](#locating-a-patients-contact--find): `find`
- [**Deleting a patient**](#deleting-a-patient--delete): `delete`

Back to [Features](#features) or [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Adding a patient : `add`

Allows you to add a new patient's information to the address book.

Format: `add n\NAME ic\IC_NUMBER dob\DATE_OF_BIRTH ad\ADMISSION_DATE w\WARD [r\REMARK] [t\TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: <b>Tip:</b>
A patient can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

You can find details about each parameter [here](#parameters-for-commands).

Additional details:

* `DATE_OF_BIRTH` : Date of birth must not be later than admission date.
* `ADMISSION_DATE` : Admission date must not be earlier than date of birth.
* `REMARK` : Remarks have no length limit, and each patient can only have **ONE** remark field.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: <b>Note:</b>
Each patient in NAB must have a unique <code>IC_NUMBER</code>. Attempting to add a patient with an 
<code>IC_NUMBER</code> that already exists will result in an error.
</div>

Example command:

`add n\John Doe ic\T1234567P dob\21/03/2000 ad\02/02/2022 w\A1 t\FallRisk r\Requires assistance feeding. t\Diabetes`

```

```

#### Listing patients : `list`

Allows you to view a list of patients in the address book. 

If you use `list` command without optional parameters, you will be able to list all patients.

You may also filter by ward and/or tags to list only patients in a specific ward and/or with specific tags.

Format: `list [w\WARD] [t\TAG]...`

You can find details about each parameter [here](#parameters-for-commands).

Additional details:

* `WARD` : Must only list at most **ONE** ward.
* Only patients with tags (and appropriate ward, if specified) that encompass all the provided tags will be listed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning"> :exclamation: <b>Caution:</b>
If you wish to list all patients, utilise the command `list` instead of using empty parameters. Otherwise, it will 
assume that it is an invalid input.
</div>

* `list` results are permissive, meaning that specified tags will be treated as case-insensitive. Patients with tags 
that meet the above criteria will be listed. 
* For the `list` commands below, we assume the list contains 2 people, John Doe and Jane Doe

Example command:

`list`
```

* `ADMISSION_DATE` : If editing the admission date, admission date must not be earlier than date of birth.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: <b>Note:</b>
Each patient in NAB must have a unique <code>IC_NUMBER</code>. Attempting to change the <code>IC_NUMBER</code> of a 
patient to one that already exists will result in an error.
</div>

Example command:

`edit 1 ic\T0123456P t\ r\` edits the `IC_NUMBER`, `TAG` and `REMARK` of the first patient to be `T0123456P` for 
`IC_NUMBER` and empty for both `TAG` and `REMARK`.

Assuming John Doe is at index 1 and previously had IC Number `T1234567P`, the tags `[FallRisk]` and `[HearingImpaired]`,
and remark `Requires assistance feeding.`, the following shows the change in contact details:

**Before**:
```
John Doe
IC: T1234567P
DOB: 21/03/2000
Ward: A1
Admission Date: 02/02/2022
Remarks: Requires assistance feeding.
Tags: [FallRisk][Diabetes]
```
**After**:
```
John Doe
IC: T0123456P
DOB: 21/03/2000
Ward: A1
Admission Date: 02/02/2022

#### Locating a patient's contact : `find`

Allows you to find patients whose name or IC contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find n\NAME` OR `find ic\IC_NUMBER`

You can find details about each parameter [here](#parameters-for-commands).

Additional details:

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* Patients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
* Only full IC will be matched e.g. `a1234567b` will not match `123`.

Example command:

* `find n\John` returns patient contacts with `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find n\alex denver` returns patient contacts with `Alex Denver` and `Denver Li`.
* `find ic\a1234567b` returns patient contacts with `A1234567B`.

#### Deleting a patient : `delete`

Allows you to delete the specified patient from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

You can find details about each parameter [here](#parameters-for-commands).

Additional details:

* Deletes the patient records at the specified `INDEX`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: <b>Tip:</b>
    In accordance with local regulations (such as PDPA), it is advisable to remove patient details once they are 
discharged.
</div>

Example command:

`delete 2` deletes the second patient in the displayed list.
```
Deleted Person: Jane Doe
IC: A1234567B
DOB: 02/02/2000
Ward: A1
Admitted: 02/02/2020
Remarks: Likes to go to the park

Format: `exit`


#### Saving the data

Data from NAB are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There 
is no need to save manually.

#### Editing the data file

NAB data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. While not
advisable given the critical nature of the system, advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the
data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning"> :exclamation: <b>Caution:</b>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NAB will discard all data and start with an empty data file 
at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause NAB to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the 
acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains 
the data of your previous NAB home folder.

**Q**: Is your platform available in other languages?<br>
**A**: NAB is currently available only in English, as it is the main language of Singapore. Support for additional 
languages will be introduced in future releases. Should patients have names in other languages, it is recommended to use
the translation provided on their NRIC/ FIN. For extenuating circumstances such as foreigners, it is recommended to use 
an approximation of their name in English. For e.g., `李小明` can be approximated as `Lee Xiaoming`, `Hallé` can be 
approximated as `Halle`.

**Q**: What is the difference between `list` and `find`?<br>
**A**: The `list` command allows you to retrieve multiple contacts, for which they are _all useful_. In contrast, the 
`find` command is used to retrieve a _specific_ useful entry. This is designed to ease the mental fatigue of nurses. 
For example, nurses may be required to "find patient John Doe", or provide a "list [of] all patients with flu symptoms".
With these two features, nurses can simply key in the request.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application window to a secondary screen, and later disconnect/turn 
off that secondary screen while the application is still open, the GUI will open off-screen on the primary screen. The 
remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running it again.

2. **When re-accessing the help window after minimising it**, the help window may not pop up again. The remedy is to 
mouse over the NAB icon and click on the preview window to bring it back to the front.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting

1. **Slow performance**: If you experience slow performance or lag while using NAB, especially on older or low-end 
systems, you can try closing other running applications to free up system resources. Additionally, you can try 
restarting the application or your system to clear any potential memory leaks or temporary issues.

2. **Error for empty tags and/or ward prefix(es) for `list`:**  The `list` command will not display patients with tags 
and/or ward prefix(es) that **do not contain** any associated content. This feature was intentionally designed to filter 
relevant patients with the appropriate tags and/or ward. As there is no use case (patients should usually have a ward 
and/or tag associated with them) for being able to look up empty tags and/or wards, it is not implemented.
